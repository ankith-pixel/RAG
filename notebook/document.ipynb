SCOPE: \\n \\nThis document explains the requirements for a Remote Diagnostic and Predictive \\nMaintenance System for Indian Railway Signalling equipment. The system will use \\nIoT to collect data, standard logics & AI/ML to monitor, diagnose, and predict equip-\\nment performance. \\n  \\nThe purpose of this FRS is to standardize and set clear requirements to ensure that \\ndata collected from any platform or IoT device is consistent and compatible. This data \\nwill be used for machine learning (ML) and AI-based data analytics for predictive \\nmaintenance. \\n \\n2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENT: \\n \\n2.1 The objective of providing Remote Diagnostic and Preventive Maintenance system is \\nto assist maintenance team in taking appropriate maintenance action in advance to \\nprevent the failure of signalling assets. At functional level the system is broadly divided \\ninto two categories: \\n \\n2.2 Remote Diagnostic: The purpose of the Remote Diagnostic System for Signalling As-\\nsets is to minimize MTTR (Mean Time to Restore) and provide real-time insights to \\nmaintenance teams for efficient resolution of signal failures. This is accomplished \\nthrough the automated analysis of telemetry data and operational parameters collected \\nfrom signalling assets via IoT enabled sensors. The system leverages edge computing \\nfor on-site processing and cloud-based analytics for advanced diagnostics. The system \\ndelivers fault alerts to mobile devices or PCs, along with possible root cause analysis \\n(RCA). This enables faster fault resolution, streamlined troubleshooting, and improved \\noperational uptime. \\n \\n2.3 Predictive Maintenance: The system facilitates predictive maintenance by delivering \\npredictive alerts to mobile devices or PCs, identifying probable causes through data \\nanalysis and AI/ML models. It continuously analyzes data from all stations to develop \\nsupervised and unsupervised machine learning models .

The system shall provide predictive maintenance and optimization \\nwith the help of advanced analytics, Machine Learning and Data visualization. \\n \\n13.2 Machine Learning algorithm should be able to suggest and predict defects, device \\nfailure and remaining useful life (RUL).  Application should be backed by intelligent \\nhealth monitoring algorithms for assets using machine leaning algorithms to predict the \\nequipment failure or errors  and send SMS alerts to the concerned official’s mobile \\nnumber. It is expected that accuracy of predictive alerts should be better than defined \\nlevels with time. \\n \\n13.3 The data received is used by the AI algorithms to improve the failure models and \\npredictive models. Initially, supervised learning will be done and gradually the learning \\nwill be more automated using AI techniques. The failures and maintenance activity data \\nshall also be used for selecting and neglecting the raw data respectively. For example, \\nif deterministic failure is reported by Edge device, the m achine learning will analyse \\ndeep data screening to relate failure pattern and update its model. While, if maintenance \\nactivity is taken where disconnection or forced shutdown of equipment is done, the \\nmachine learning algorithm will discard such data to prevent wrong learning. \\n \\n13.4 The existing failure models and predictive models are updated time to time by the \\nMachine learning above. The real-time data of signalling gears is analysed with these \\nmachine learning models. The ML algorithms are applied to reveal hidden correlations \\nin data sets and detect abnormal data patterns. The recognized data patterns are \\nreflected to generate the predictive health information of signalling equipment. \\n \\n13.5 The initial development rules include  defining the allowable parameter limits. For \\nexample, if monitored 24V DC power supply for and equipment like axle counter of so \\nand so make goes below “x” volt (as per equipment manual), it is likely to fail.  \\n \\n13.6 By monitoring patterns in real time and looking at historical data, the machine learning \\ncan identify repeat scenarios which it can then create rules for moving forward. Like in \\nabove example, after machine learning, the axle counter parameter limit will be fine -\\ntuned together with information from other parameters like ambient temperature,  level \\nof induced voltage in cable etc. This process is an adaptive learning process, meaning \\nthat the system will use AI techniques to find pattern in data . The more dat a and \\nscenarios it collect and encounter, the more it will self learn. \\n \\n13.7 It is desirable that Cloud and AI shall be based on open source platforms and AI \\nalgorithms developed shall be property of Indian Railways.

Necessary APIs/data format should be designed in RDPMS \\nsystem in consultation with Railway Cloud (CRIS or as decided by Railway \\nmanagement) to ensure smooth flow of desired packets. Details of packets have \\nbeen given ahead in this Annexure B. \\n \\n1.2 Intermediate Service Platform (ISP): The Intermediate Service Platform (ISP) is \\na secure and intelligent middleware designed to facilitate seamless communication \\nbetween Station Gateways and the Cloud (RDPMS) Application. It manages bidi-\\nrectional command and data exchanges, including time synchronization, system \\ndiscovery, configuration commands, continuous parameter monitoring, and sensor \\nhealth updates. ISP should be compliant to MQTT specifications. \\n \\nThe ISP ensures reliable and secure data transmission through built -in acknowl-\\nedgment mechanisms, retry logic, and encryption. It supports logging and auditing \\nof all transactions, handles large data payloads, and is designed to scale across \\ndistributed infrastructure with fault tolerance for continuous uptime. \\n \\nFurthermore, the ISP provides an option for authorized third-party systems to \\naccess real-time data streams via a subscription model.  \\n \\nISP shall operate on a publish-subscribe communication model as follows: \\n- Publishers (message senders) may publish messages to designated topics. \\n- Subscribers (message receivers) can subscribe to these topics to receive the \\ncorresponding messages. \\n- A single topic can support multiple concurrent subscribers, all of whom will re-\\nceive the messages published to that topic. \\n \\nTechnical and Security Considerations: \\n \\nCertificate-Based Authentication: All publishers and subscribers must be au-\\nthenticated using digital certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). \\nOnly clients with valid certificates will be allowed to establish a connection to the \\nISP. \\n \\nCertificate Blacklisting and Revocation: The ISP shall maintain a dynamic Cer-\\ntificate Revocation List (CRL)  or implement  Online Certificate Status Protocol \\n(OCSP) to ensure that compromised, expired, or unauthorized certificates are de-\\nnied access. Clients with blacklisted certificates will be automatically disconnected \\nand denied any further interaction with the platform. \\n \\nEncrypted Communication: All communication between publishers, subscribers, \\nand the ISP shall be secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to ensure data \\nconfidentiality and integrity. \\n \\n3199209(1)/2025/O/o PCSTE/HQ/ECR\\n70\\nFile No. ECR-HQ0SnT(OTH)/7/2024-O/o Dy.CSTE/Sig/HQ/ECR (Computer No. 279747)\\nGenerated from eOffice by TARKESHWAR SINGH, CH.OS/STORE/S&T/HQ/ECR/TS, CH.OS/STORE/S&T/HQ/ECR, EAST CENTRAL RAILWAY HQ on 25/06/2025 03:51 PM'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\1757402904205-ECR-HQ0S&T (RBCT) 1 2024 Dt- 25.06.2025 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION FOR Remote Diagnostic and Predictive Maintenance System (RDPMS)(Version 1.0)..pdf', 'total_pages': 281, 'page': 70, 'page_label': '71'}, page_content='70 \\n \\nAccess Control and Topic Authorization:  Publishers and subscribers shall be \\nallowed to publish or subscribe only to authorized topics, as defined in the access \\ncontrol policies.

The CA's signature on your certificate is like an official stamp that can't be forged \\nIn this system, each vendor acts as their own CA, issuing certificates to all their enti-\\nties.

Encryption/Decryption Process: \\no After successful mTLS handshake, all communication is encrypted \\no Data is encrypted using negotiated session keys (not the certificate keys) \\no Common cipher suites include TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 or \\nTLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 or any other. \\n3199209(1)/2025/O/o PCSTE/HQ/ECR\\n82\\nFile No. ECR-HQ0SnT(OTH)/7/2024-O/o Dy.CSTE/Sig/HQ/ECR (Computer No. 279747)\\nGenerated from eOffice by TARKESHWAR SINGH, CH.OS/STORE/S&T/HQ/ECR/TS, CH.OS/STORE/S&T/HQ/ECR, EAST CENTRAL RAILWAY HQ on 25/06/2025 03:51 PM'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\1757402904205-ECR-HQ0S&T (RBCT) 1 2024 Dt- 25.06.2025 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION FOR Remote Diagnostic and Predictive Maintenance System (RDPMS)(Version 1.0)..pdf', 'total_pages': 281, 'page': 82, 'page_label': '83'}, page_content='82 \\n \\nPart 2: Step-by-Step Certificate Creation Process \\nFiles Security Classification \\nPrivate (Never Share or Expose): \\n• All private keys (*.key files) \\n• CA private key (ca.key) is especially sensitive and should have the highest protec-\\ntion \\nRestricted (Internal Use Only): \\n• CA certificate signing request (ca.csr) \\n• Entity certificate signing requests (*.csr files) \\n• CA database files (index.txt, serial, etc.) \\nPublic (Can Be Shared): \\n• CA certificate (ca.crt) - must be distributed to all entities \\n• Entity certificates (isp.crt, cg.crt, sg1.crt, etc.) \\n• Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) \\n \\n1.

These logics are primitive logics for Prediction of failures. However,  in addition to these primi-\\ntive logics, these primitive logics, various AI/ML Techniques and learning models need to be \\ndeveloped and applied by Vendors for prediction of failures.  The models used by them shall \\nbe shared with Zonal Railways/RDSO. \\n2. Comparisons in logics have been made with deviation in parameter value in terms of certain % \\nof avg value OR deviation from Min/Max safe. Although % deviation has been given for predic-\\ntive logics for reference, however, % may be modified as decided by Zonal Railway.  This % is \\nbeing denoted as LD1, LD2, LD3 for lower side deviation and as HD1, HD2  for higher \\nside deviation. For DC Track ckts, LD1=80, LD3=90, LD2=50, HD1=120, HD2=150. \\n3. For Predictive logic, the analog continuous deviation (say < than 80% of avg value) should oc-\\ncur for at least certain duration  to avoid predictive alerts for short transients. Indicative timing \\nhas been mentioned against logics.  However, time duration can be decided by Zonal Railways \\nas per site requirement. \\n4. The deviation should occur for entire duration of at least  1 operation in discrete cases like volt-\\nage and current of  point machine.  \\n5. Prediction Logics have been given based on defined parameters. However, Vendors may add \\nnew logics and modify given logics based on new parameters added OR otherwise also  under \\napproval of Railways and under intimation to RDSO sothat suitable amendment may be issued \\nin FRS after review.  \\n \\n cause_detail Logic cause_code Remarks on Logics \\n1 Track Ckt predictive \\nAlert for T----: \\nTFC input voltage  \\nLow/failed in Loc. \\n[ TPR ↑  \\n&& \\nVIPS TR-1 110 AC    ≥  Min safe value \\n&& \\nVTC TFC I/P  < \\n \\n] \\n \\nTC TFC I/P \\nVOLT LOW \\n[ ] Logic is checked \\nfor 15 min. \\n \\n \\n2 Track Ckt predictive \\nAlert for T----: \\nBattery charging but \\nbut TFC output volt-\\nage Low/fail. \\n  \\n[ \\nTPR ↑  \\n&& \\nITC BATT CHARG > 0+ \\n&& \\nVIPS TR-1 110 AC    ≥  Min safe value \\n&& \\nTC TFC O/P \\nVOLT LOW \\n[ ] Logic is checked \\nfor 30 sec when \\nBattery is being \\ncharged. \\n \\nAvg value of VTC TFC \\nO/P   should be cal-\\nculated when Track \\nBattery charging \\nCurrent ie ITC BATT \\nCHARG is more than \\nLD1% of avg  \\nvalue OR Min \\nsafe value \\nLD1% of avg  \\nvalue OR Min \\nsafe value \\n3199209(1)/2025/O/o PCSTE/HQ/ECR\\n119\\nFile No. ECR-HQ0SnT(OTH)/7/2024-O/o Dy.CSTE/Sig/HQ/ECR (Computer No. 279747)\\nGenerated from eOffice by TARKESHWAR SINGH, CH.OS/STORE/S&T/HQ/ECR/TS, CH.OS/STORE/S&T/HQ/ECR, EAST CENTRAL RAILWAY HQ on 25/06/2025 03:51 PM'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'PyPDF', 'creator': 'PyPDF', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\1757402904205-ECR-HQ0S&T (RBCT) 1 2024 Dt- 25.06.2025 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION FOR Remote Diagnostic and Predictive Maintenance System (RDPMS)(Version 1.0)..pdf', 'total_pages': 281, 'page': 119, 'page_label': '120'}, page_content='119 \\n \\nVTC TFC O/P  < \\n \\n] \\n0.

However,  in addition to these primi-\\ntive logics, these primitive logics, various AI/ML Techniques and learning models need to be \\ndeveloped and applied by Vendors for prediction of failures.  The models used by them shall \\nbe shared with Zonal Railways/RDSO. \\n2. Comparisons in logics have been made with deviation in parameter value in terms of certain \\n% of avg value OR deviation from Min/Max safe. Although % deviation has been given for \\npredictive logics for reference, however, % may be modified as decided by Zonal Rail-\\nway.This % is being denoted by “LD” for lower side deviation and “HD” for higher side \\ndeviation. For Calling ON Signal, LD=80 and HD=120. \\n3. For Predictive logic, the analog continuous deviation (say < than 80% of avg value) should oc-\\ncur for at least certain duration to avoid predictive alerts for short transients. Indicative timing \\nhas been mentioned against logics.  However, time duration can be decided by Zonal Rail-\\nways as per site requirement. \\n4.

For example, consider following request: \\n{    \"start_date\": \"12/11/2023\", \\n    \"start_time\": \"12:40:20\", \\n    \"end_date\": \"20/11/2023\", \\n    \"end_time\": \"13:35:30\", \\n    \"request\": { \\n        \"zone\": [ \\n            \"NR\" \\n        ], \\n        \"station\": [ \\n            \"DHN\" \\n        ] \\n    } \\n} \\nNow, since DHN station is not part of NR zone and both keys present here (zone and station), the API will ignore higher key and process based on lower key. This \\nbehaviour should be only applicable with – zone, division, section, station and asset number related keys.

Introduction\\nThe performance and safety of railway systems are signiﬁcantly affected by railway\\npoint machines (RPMs) [ 1], one of the most critical pieces of equipment in railway signaling\\nsystems. An RPM consists of an electric motor and mechanical assembly , which move,\\ndetect, and lock the end position of the point tongue either individually or following the\\ndirection of the route formed. According to some relevant studies, over the years, failures\\nin RPMs have been the most frequent cause of faults in railway signaling systems, which\\nhas a signiﬁcant impact on the efﬁciency and safety of train operation [ 2– 4]. In addition,\\nat present, conventional maintenance for RPM equipment is mostly employed by railway\\noperators, utilizing large amounts of manpower and material resources [ 5]. In order to\\noptimize the effectiveness of machine operation, reduce unplanned downtime, and decrease\\noperational and maintenance expenses, it becomes imperative to create an intelligent fault\\ndiagnosis (FD) method for RPM equipment. The method should be designed to evaluate\\nthe health status, aiming to identify the type, severity , and degradation trend of potential\\nfaults [ 6]. The FD method also has a big impact on increasing the quality and efﬁciency\\nof maintenance by providing appropriate maintenance recommendations based on the\\ncurrent state of the equipment [ 7].\\nIn a dynamic system, there are three main methods of fault diagnosis [ 8]: model-based\\nfault diagnosis, knowledge-based fault diagnosis, and data-driven-based fault diagnosis.\\nModel-based fault diagnosis compares a measured signal with the actual process output\\nand its estimation generated in terms of an appropriate mathematical model of the system\\nworking under normal operating parameters [ 8]. Knowledge-based fault diagnosis focuses\\nAppl.

Data-driven fault diagnosis derives valuable\\ninformation from data captured by sensors and actuators in a dynamic system [ 9]. In re-\\ncent years, data-driven fault diagnosis for railway point machines has received increased\\nattention [ 10] because there is no requirement to model the system. There are two methods\\nused in data-driven-based fault diagnosis: statistical and machine learning methods [ 8].\\nThe machine learning method has many advantages over the statistical method, including\\nits ability to learn the entire system’s behavior with a few datasets [ 8], describe very com-\\nplex and non-linear systems with great accuracy in defect identiﬁcation, and discover new\\nissues or errors with insufﬁcient data [ 8].\\nIn recent years, various sensors, including voltage [ 11], current [ 11], force [ 11], acous-\\ntic [ 2], and vibration [ 12], have been employed in the FD method for RPM equipment.\\nThe implementation of a current sensor is the most practical since it does not interfere\\nwith operations and can be installed in the power supply , which is located inside the\\nequipment room in the station area, rather than inside the RPM equipment or ﬁeld area [ 11].\\nFurthermore, electric current data can be used to diagnose not just electrical but also\\nmechanical failures [ 13].\\nSeveral studies have shown promising outcomes in utilizing this method for diag-\\nnosing faults in railway point machines. For instance, Asada et al. [ 11] applied wavelet\\ntransforms and Support V ector Machines (SVMs) to detect RPM faults using voltage and\\ncurrent data, and the experimental results demonstrated 100% cross-validation accuracy .\\nJin et al. [ 14] successfully combined the self-organizing map-minimum quantization error\\nand principal component analysis T 2 for classifying RPM conditions utilizing voltage and\\ncurrent data, achieving 81% classiﬁcation accuracy in fault detection. Sa et al. [ 15] experi-\\nmented to determine whether it was worth replacing RPM using current-data and shapelet\\nmethods, achieving 97% accuracy for balanced data and 95% accuracy for unbalanced data\\nin fault detection. Guo et al. [ 16] examined current data and utilized the stacked autoen-\\ncoder method to detect failures in RPM equipment, achieving 100% accuracy . However ,\\nthese studies give numerous methods for detecting or diagnosing failures that use two or\\nmore sensors in data monitoring. The smaller number of sensors utilized in the FD method\\ncould reduce installation costs [\\n17]. So, further study on the use of only electric current data\\nis required to give low-cost and accurate solutions in the FD method (multi-classiﬁcation\\nproblems) for RPM equipment.\\nAs a result, the purpose of this research is to examine the use of time-series current data\\nand machine learning (ML) techniques in fault diagnosis for railway point machines. When\\ncompared to frequency-domain and time–frequency-domain analysis, time-domain analy-\\nsis is one of the most frequently utilized signal-processing methods since it has the lowest\\ncomputational cost without neglecting useful information from motor conditions [ 18,19].\\nSix ML algorithms will be employed in order to determine which model performs the\\nbest in the fault diagnosis of railway point machines: Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest\\nNeighbor (kNN), Support V ector Machine (SVM), Decision T ree (DT), Random Forest (RF),\\nand Artiﬁcial Neural Network (ANN). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.\\nSection 2 describes the methodology . Section 3 presents the research outcomes. Section 4\\ndiscusses the results.

In this paper ,\\n5-fold cross-validation was used in the proposed method, as it has proven to be the most\\nefﬁcient approach with the lowest computing cost and the best outcome [ 26]. The 5-fold\\ncross-validation approach divided the training datasets into 5 folds, with 80% of the data\\n(4 folds) used as a training set and 20% of the data (1 fold) used to validate the ML model’s\\naccuracy (80/20 ratio) [ 26]. This procedure was repeated ﬁve times with different validation\\ndata. Each validation iteration yielded an accuracy and an error value. The mean or average\\nof the accuracy and error values was used to calculate the 5-fold cross-validation results.\\nFivefold cross-validation was performed in order to evaluate hyperparameter variations.\\nMore hyperparameters needed more iterations to obtain the grid search cross-validation\\nresults.

The machine learning parameters\\nthat were investigated in grid search 5-fold cross-validation were as follows: the parameter\\nin the LR algorithm was the C value (range 1–10); the parameter in the kNN algorithm\\nwas the number of neighbors (range 1–10); the parameters in the SVM algorithm were\\nthe C value (range 1–10), gamma value (range 0.1–1), and kernel type (linear or rbf); the\\nparameters in the DT algorithm were the maximum depth of the tree (range 1–5) and\\nthe criterion function (gini or entropy); the parameters in the RF algorithm were the\\nnumber of trees in the forest (range 1–5) and the criterion function (gini or entropy); and\\nthe parameters in the ANN were the number of hidden layers, neurons, and epochs, as\\nwell as the batch size. Because of the dataset’s shorter dimension, the proposed ANN\\ntechnique employed only one hidden layer using the feedforward propagation technique.\\nFurthermore, the input layer contained 10 nodes, the hidden layer contained 7 nodes,\\nand the output layer contained 3 nodes.

By making use of the\\nbeneﬁts of current-signal measurements, the implementation of sensor monitoring is safer\\nsince it can be installed inside the equipment room of the station; therefore, the measure-\\nments do not interfere with operations since the current sensor senses the current based\\non electromagnetic principles. In addition, the installation cost is low because it uses only\\none sensor . The usage of the current sensor in the suggested technique for monitoring\\nRPM equipment will also contribute to cost efﬁciency . Time-domain feature extraction\\nbased on scalable hypothesis testing aids in the identiﬁcation of important features in fault\\ndiagnosis, avoiding overﬁtting or underﬁtting in the machine learning model. The chosen\\ncharacteristics constitute the dataset for machine learning modeling, and the optimum\\nparameters are obtained and utilized to train the ideal models using grid search 5-fold\\ncross-validation. T wo ML algorithms, DT and RF , performed very well in classifying RPM\\nconditions, and the ANN and SVM algorithms also showed good accuracy . However , the\\nother algorithms, LR and KNN, performed poorly , especially in classifying conditions 1 and\\n2. The primary explanation for this is the similarity of the current-data patterns between\\nconditions 1 and 2. However , the DT and RF algorithms could manage these issues and\\ncorrectly classify the RPM situations.\\nT able 4 compares earlier works on current-signal-based fault diagnosis for railway\\npoint machines. The method proposed in this study for classifying RPM equipment\\nconditions using current signals demonstrated excellent accuracy in the application to\\nfault diagnosis with multi-classiﬁcations, whereas previous works only investigated binary\\nclassiﬁcations in the fault detection of railway point machines.\\nT able 4.

Conclusions\\nIn this research, we proposed a fault diagnosis approach based on current signals\\nand machine learning methods for railway point machines. In this approach, the collected\\ncurrent signals from the test-bench experiment are converted into time-series data. Then,\\ntime-domain feature extraction based on scalable hypothesis testing is utilized to select\\nthe relevant features for the classiﬁcations. Finally , the selected features are employed in\\nmachine learning modeling to determine which ML algorithms perform the best. The re-\\nsearch results demonstrate that the LR and kNN algorithms can achieve high accuracy ,\\nalbeit lower than 90%. Furthermore, the SVM, DT , RF , and ANN algorithms show great\\naccuracy (higher than 90%) in the fault diagnosis of railway point machines, especially the\\nDT algorithm, which achieves a testing accuracy of 100% in classifying RPM equipment.\\nThis study has some limitations. For example, the data were collected via a test bench,\\nrather than in the ﬁeld; the current-monitoring system was not developed using industrial\\ndata acquisition; and the number of multi-classiﬁcations can be further increased.

The potential challenges and barriers to its adoption will\\nbe technically complex for maintenance teams due to sensor reliability and cost implications,\\nand the fault diagnosis system must meet industry requirements.\\nScaling up the implementation of current-signal-based fault diagnosis for railway point\\nmachines across a larger railway network will require several considerations such as sensor\\nnetwork architecture, communication architecture, big data management, robust algo-\\nrithms, and big data interpretability . There are several strategies for overcoming the scalabil-\\nity issue, for instance, pilot testing, incremental implementation, and\\ncontinuous improvements.\\nFurther research into combining data from other sensors, such as vibration and acous-\\ntic sensors, is also needed. A potential beneﬁt of combining data from vibration and\\nacoustic sensors is that both sensors could monitor the railway point machine all the time,\\neven when the railway point machine is not in operation, whereas current sensors only\\nmonitor the railway point machine when it is in operation. Furthermore, the use of both\\nsensors would increase the availability of condition monitoring. Additionally , combining\\ncurrent, vibration, and acoustic sensors would give more information about the machine’s\\nconditions, especially in terms of electrical-mechanical parameters, resulting in a compre-\\nhensive fault diagnosis model. However , the potential drawback of combining data from\\nvibration and acoustic sensors is that the installation must be placed in a railway point\\nmachine, which is not easy in a narrow RPM space. The installation must comply with the\\nsafety of the machine’s operation. In addition, the complexity of signal processing would\\nbe increased due to the condition monitoring of several signals in the RPM.\\nAll problems and challenges will be future research topics since they are unavoidable\\nbarriers to the development and implementation of RPM intelligent fault diagnosis. Ad-\\ndressing these problems via continuous scientiﬁc research will pave the way for innovative\\nsolutions, enabling the continual improvement and reﬁnement of railway point machine\\n(RPM) intelligent fault diagnostic systems. Researchers could investigate innovative meth-\\nods, technologies, and strategies to overcome these challenges, eventually adding to the\\nrobustness and efﬁcient adoption of intelligent fault diagnosis in railway operations.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, A.S. and W .A.C.; methodology , A.S. and W .A.C.; software,\\nY .Y .; validation, A.S., W .A.C. and Y .Y .; formal analysis, W .A.C. and Y .Y .; investigation, A.S.; resources,\\nA.S. and Y .Y .; data curation, A.S., W .A.C. and Y .Y .; writing—original draft preparation, Y .Y .; visualiza-\\ntion, Y .Y .; supervision, A.S. and W .A.C.; project administration, Y .Y .; funding acquisition, A.S.

The\\nworking state of its equipment directly determines the safety of\\ntrain operation. However, the poor working environment of the\\nrailway point machine and the most frequent actions make the\\nhighest fault rate in the railway signal infrastructure. At present,\\nthe main artiﬁcial experience diagnosis method has the prob-\\nlems of a low efﬁciency, high cost, and high misdiagnosis rate.\\nIn turn, they cannot meet the ﬁeld requirements. Therefore, the\\ndiagnosis of this equipment needs to be as efﬁcient and accurate\\nas possible.\\nAt present, the automatic diagnosis of railway point machine\\nfaults has been studied by many scholars at home and abroad\\n[3, 4]. It can be divided into diagnosis models based on machine\\nlearning [5–7] and deep learning algorithms. Machine learning\\nmodels typically use simple formulas to deﬁne the association\\nThis is an open access article under the terms of theCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivsLicense, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the\\noriginal work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modiﬁcations or adaptations are made.\\n© 2023 The Authors.IET Intelligent Transport Systemspublished by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Institution of Engineering and Technology.\\nmodel. Therefore, the features need to be extracted manually.\\nThe modelling process is too idealistic, and the robustness\\nis not good. Moreover, the fault features extracted manually\\nare not comprehensive. On one hand, the features that reﬂect\\nminor faults are easily deleted by mistake or concealed by noise.\\nOn the other hand, the extracted features are primarily used to\\nsolve speciﬁc fault problems [8, 9]. They have poor universality\\nand are difﬁcult to complete in the context of big data. The\\nmain reason for the above defects is that most of the models\\nused in the existing fault diagnosis algorithms are shallow\\nstructures. The feature extraction ability is weak. However,\\ndiagnosis models based on deep learning have been widely used\\nbecause they can be trained to extract features automatically\\n[10]. Furthermore, the CNN is representative of deep learning\\nmethods. The original signal is directly used as input to simulate\\nthe complex relationship between input and output. It reduces\\nthe dependence on expert experience and does not need to\\nextract features manually. It is increasingly used in mechanical\\nfault diagnosis.

In addition, valuable fault information is scarce in fault\\ndiagnosis. Also, the essence of fault diagnosis is a pattern recog-\\nnition problem. Correspondingly, accurate feature extraction is\\ncritical for fault diagnosis [12, 13]. However, a critical classiﬁer\\nor cluster is also required. Also, this process is quantiﬁed as the\\nﬁnal diagnosis process. Besides, insufﬁcient training samples\\nand an unbalanced sample distribution will result in overﬁt-\\nting issues. Therefore, we will propose an improved DCNN\\nstructure to solve the above mentioned fault feature extraction\\nproblem in this study.\\nConsequently, effective fault feature extraction is accom-\\nplished using improved DCNN structure. However, fault and\\nfault samples are scarce because of the lack of on-site fault data.\\nIn turn, it easily causes overﬁtting and poor noise immunity.\\nConsequently, the normalization ability of the training model\\nis poor. However, the condition monitoring and diagnosis of\\nmechanical equipment is a very typical unbalanced classiﬁcation\\nproblem. We urgently need to solve the problem of classify-\\ning the unbalanced samples. Fortunately, a lot of researches\\non unbalanced fault diagnosis has already appeared [41–43].\\nAlthough the traditional methods of unbalanced sample clas-\\nsiﬁcation can achieve certain results. However, they still have\\nthe following shortcomings [44–47]. Speciﬁcally, the follow-\\ning: Limited by the poor collection and production conditions,\\nthe number of training set has difﬁculty meeting the above\\nassumptions. In turn, the accuracy and reliability of the trained\\nclassiﬁcation model are poor. Therefore, the support vector\\ndata description (SVDD) is used to construct a single class of\\nhyperspheres for fault features in this paper. An improved quan-\\ntity learning algorithm for hypersphere coordinate mapping is\\nproposed.\\nAfter the above analysis and research, our improvement and\\nthe innovations of this study are as follows. The improvement\\nof the CNN network is mainly divided into the following two\\nsteps. First, the depthwise separable convolution in the Xcep-\\ntion structure is used to optimize the extraction of fault features.\\nThen, the adaptive batch normalization processing (AdaBN)\\nis performed to improve the noise immunity. Meanwhile, the\\nglobal average pooling layer (GAP) is used instead of the fully\\nconnected layer to improve the generalization ability of the\\nnetwork.

In a 380 V three-\\nphase power supply, the two phases formed a loop through the\\nrepresentation circuit. The two phases are dependent on the\\nexisting current. At the end of the 1DQJ cache, the three-phase\\ncurrent is 0. The three-phase current of the alternating current\\nis expressed in terms of A, B, and C. The power is expressed in\\nterms of P . When the fault occurs, its action current curve would\\nalso be fault. Several common railway point machine faults and\\ntheir causes are given in Table1.\\n2.2 Fault diagnosis based on traditional\\nmachine learning\\nWith the continuous rise of machine learning research, data-\\ndriven intelligent fault diagnosis had gradually become the\\nmainstream method in the fault diagnosis [6, 7, 14]. The tradi-\\ntional intelligent fault diagnosis method usually includes three\\nsteps: Feature extraction, feature selection, and fault classiﬁ-\\ncation. Feature extraction was the key link of fault diagnosis.\\nHowever, machine learning requires manual feature extraction,\\nand the key to the success was the selection of a feature extrac-\\ntor and classiﬁer. Therefore, feature extraction requires much\\nwork and high requirements for designers. The shallow net-\\nwork learning ability was insufﬁcient. Therefore, the diagnosis\\naccuracy was not high. Other commonly used methods include\\nwavelet transform (WT) [15], spectral analysis (SA) [16]a n d\\nempirical modal decomposition (EMD) [17].\\nAlthough these methods can achieve certain diagnosis results,\\ntheir accuracy was relatively low . Feature selection removed the\\nfeatures with low sensitivity and utility from the extracted fea-\\ntures. Thus, the aim of reducing the number of features and\\nredundancy of fault features was achieved. Common methods\\nprimarily include principal component analysis (PCA) [18]a n d\\nindependent component analysis (ICA) [19]. Fault classiﬁca-\\ntion inputs selected features into fault classiﬁers for recognition\\nand trains the fault classiﬁcation results by repeated iterations.\\nThe BP neural network (BPNN) [20], support vector machine\\n(SVM), and K-nearest neighbour method (KNN) have been\\nwidely used as back-end fault classiﬁers [21]. In 2016, an intelli-\\ngent diagnosis method for high-speed railway turnouts based on\\nSVM was proposed. Also, it used expert experience and knowl-\\nedge to compute feature vectors [22]. In 2017, a hybrid feature\\nextraction method was proposed. It extracted information in\\nthe time and frequency domain from the turnout signal, and the\\nSVM was used for signal recognition. The introduction of low\\nfrequency features made fault diagnosis more sensitive to more\\ntypes of faults [23]. As shown by ref. [24], an SVM was proposed\\nas the core. Moreover, different algorithms were adopted to\\nachieve fault diagnosis. As shown by ref. [25], EMD and WT sig-\\nnal analysis methods were combined to extract signal envelope\\nfeatures. The most effective features were used for classiﬁcation\\nto realize fault diagnosis.\\nIn 2012, a method combining Bayesian network and fault\\ndiagnosis was proposed for fault diagnosis of railway point\\nmachine. However, it required high prior knowledge [26]. In\\n2014, a diagnosis method based on BPNN was proposed. It\\nwas based on the change rule of the curve to be detected\\nfor the turnout. The mapping dataset was established, and the\\nclassiﬁcation was processed through the neural network [27].\\nRef. [28] proposed an efﬁcient Bayesian network based on\\nrough set reduction. The complex relation between fault mode\\nand fault cause was modelled to realize fault diagnosis. Ref.\\n[29] combined neural network technology with grey correla-\\ntion analysis to establish the corresponding fault feature for the\\npower curve in common fault modes. First, the grey relational\\ndegree between fault curves and power curves was computed\\nby a grey neural network. Second, the fault mode of the equip-\\nment was judged according to the correlation degree. Finally, the\\nintelligent fault diagnosis of the railway point machine was real-\\nized. Ref. [30] proposed a fault diagnosis method with strong\\ncomputing power to address uncertain knowledge reasoning\\nproblems based on a standard Bayesian network. Although this\\nmodel can obtain some effect, it easily falls into the locally\\noptimal and reduced search space. Moreover, the model only\\nanalyses the circuit fault of the railway point machine. In the\\nactual fault record of a railway point machine, most of the faults\\nwere caused by mechanical reasons. Therefore, circuit faults\\nhad no practical diagnosis signiﬁcance. As shown by ref. [31],\\nfour diagnosis models were compared. The optimal conclusion\\nof the multilayer bidirectional model was obtained according\\nto the experiment. Finally, the integrated attention mechanism\\nincreased the accuracy of fault classiﬁcation to 97.6%.\\nTo conclude, the above algorithms have poor feature extrac-\\ntion capability due to their shallow network structure, which\\nmakes it difﬁcult to mine. The tiny features in the deeper level\\nof fault data is difﬁcult to extract. Moreover, scholars usually\\nadopted the method of combining manual feature extraction\\nwith a shallow machine learning model for fault diagnosis.\\nAlthough they has some effect, they has many shortcomings.\\nOn one hand, feature selection must depend on the experience\\nand professional knowledge of engineers. In turn, it is subjective\\nand blind. It can be seen although traditional machine learn-\\ning methods can achieve certain results in fault diagnosis, the\\naccuracy is low .\\n2.3 Fault diagnosis based on deep learning\\nDeep learning (DL) methods have a strong feature extraction\\nability and can automatically extract features from massive data.\\nThe mapping relationship between input data and fault cat-\\negories was well represented by establishing a deep learning\\nmodel. It was very suitable for monitoring data diagnosis with\\na large data volume, feature non-linearity, and high dimension-\\nality. In 2006, Hinton et al.

In recent years, scholars have\\napplied CNN in the fault diagnosis. A CNN model was used in\\nthe fault diagnosis of asynchronous motors. Although both of\\nfault diagnosis used the CNN, the traditional feature extraction\\nmethod was still needed to extract the original vibration data\\n[36]. Therefore, it failed to make full use of CNN’s powerful\\nfeature extraction capability, which limited the further improve-\\nment of the fault diagnosis effect. Qu et al. [37] proposed an\\nalgorithm based on a one-dimensional CNN for fault diagno-\\nsis. The training parameters of the fully connected layer of the\\nCNN model were too large, which leaded to a long training and\\ntesting time. As shown by ref. [38], a feature learning model\\nbased on a CNN was proposed. Fault diagnosis was performed\\nthrough self-learning of useful features. The better performance\\nwas obtained than those of manual feature extraction and ran-\\ndom forest combination. Wang et al. [39] proposed an adaptive\\nCNN and applied it to the fault diagnosis of railway point\\nmachines. The feature was extracted automatically by a CNN to\\navoid artiﬁcial feature extraction. Particle swarm optimization\\nwas used to determine the main parameters. Ki Bum Lee et al.\\n[40] proposed a CNN model. The fault features of multi-sensor\\nsignals were extracted along the time axis to correlate the out-\\nput. Thus, the variable and time information representing the\\nfault was found. Lu et al. [41] used a CNN to directly learn fea-\\ntures from frequency data of vibration signals. The performance\\ndifferences caused by extracting features from three types of\\ndata (raw data, spectrum, and time-frequency combination data)\\nwere compared. In recent years, the Inception network struc-\\nture and attention mechanism were major breakthroughs in the\\ndevelopment process of deep learning. It had been applied in\\nmany ﬁelds, showing great superiority. The possibility of simul-\\ntaneous application in the fault diagnosis was indicated. Szegedy\\net al. [42] achieved the best result by stacking the Inception\\nnetwork structure to form GoogLeNet for optimization anal-\\nysis. Chen et al. [43] applied the attention mechanism to CNN\\nand proposed a spectral analysis CNN (SA-CNN). Spatial atten-\\ntion and channel wise attention have been added to CNN to\\ncomplete the task of fault diagnosis.\\nAs mentioned in the above analysis, the methods of CNN\\nwere increasingly used in the fault diagnosis. Although these\\nmethods were more accurate than traditional machine learning\\nmethods, they also had their own limitations and disadvantages.\\nThe generalization ability of most of the previous CNN mod-\\nels was not strong. Therefore, they could only be applied to the\\nparts under the current load. Once the load changed (such as\\nfrom noise changes, work environment changes), the accuracy\\nwould be reduced. In addition, some network model designs\\nhad too many layers. On one hand, it was difﬁcult to train\\nor even suffer degradation when the network was deep. On\\nthe other hand, the deeper the network was, the more prone\\nit was to overﬁtting. Therefore, the training set accuracy was\\nhigh, while the test set accuracy was low . Compared with pic-\\ntures or other high-dimensional data, one-dimensional fault data\\nwere relatively concise and clear. The relatively simple models\\ncould be used to fully express the information behind the data.\\nMoreover, the output stability of some network models was not\\nideal. The accuracy was difﬁcult to maintain at a high level. The\\nimprovement of neural networks had become the focus of cur-\\nrent research and development directions. As shown by ref. [44],\\nthe autoencoder was used to ﬁrst denoise the signal. Then, it\\nwas input into the one-dimensional CNN model to realize fault\\ndiagnosis. However, two models needed to be trained. Also, the\\nsignal-to-noise ratio of the test signal was only 1 dB. As shown\\nby ref. [45], a deep learning model with certain anti-noise prop-\\nerties was proposed. However, it could not processes the data.\\nAlso, the signal-to-noise ratio of the test signal was only 0 dB at\\nthe lowest. The strong noise interference below 0 dB was not\\nstudied, or the diagnosis effect was poor.\\nIt can be seen from the above analysis that there are still many\\nproblems with the improvement and application of CNN in the\\nfault diagnosis.\\n2.4 Unbalanced sample classiﬁcation based\\non single classiﬁcation\\nThe so-called unbalanced sample was that the number of sam-\\nples in each category varies greatly or even there are missing\\nsamples. Sufﬁcient training samples with a uniform category\\ndistribution were an important prerequisite for ensuring that\\nthe classiﬁcation. When unbalanced dataset was used to pattern\\nrecognition, there would be the following problems: First, the\\nnetwork could not better learn the features of minority sam-\\nples. Therefore, the accuracy rate of the classiﬁer decreased\\nto a few classes, and the classiﬁcation performance decreased.\\nThe probability of misclassifying a few classes into many classes\\nwould be greatly increased. Then, it would be meaningless to\\ntake the accuracy rate as the index. For example, there were\\n99 normal samples and one fault sample. When the classiﬁer\\nreturns all samples to the normal, its accuracy rate was still\\n99%. Finally, noise also had a great effect on the features of a\\nfew classes in unbalanced classiﬁcation [46, 47]. Therefore, how\\nto improve the fault diagnosis performance in the unbalanced\\nsamples was a key problem. At present, the single classiﬁca-\\ntion was the most researched on the unbalanced sample. The\\nmany normal samples were used for training to achieve bet-\\nter fault diagnosis performance. Wang et al. [48] introduced a\\none-class SVM into the ﬁeld of network security and obtained\\nbetter diagnosis performance in the traditional kernel method.\\nMa et al. [49] proposed a one-class SVM based on divergence\\nfor network fault diagnosis. They converted the original data\\ninto a new space according to the divergence representation of\\nthe data. A one-class SVM model was established in the space,\\nand the data features were reduced by the PCA method. Chen\\net al. [50] proposed a one-class SVM that combines statisti-\\ncal density information. In this method, an undirected graph\\nwas constructed using normal data points. The sample ordering\\nwas obtained by computing the average KNN distance of the\\nsample. Moreover, the sorting comparison results of the paired\\nsamples were fed back to the one-class SVM. In the diagno-\\nsis stage, the sorting threshold of the data samples was used to\\ndetermine whether there were any faults.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.0.0 (Windows)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2023-08-16T17:39:36+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-16T17:40:39+05:30', 'wps-journaldoi': '10.1049/(ISSN)1751-9578', 'wps-proclevel': '3', 'keywords': '', 'title': 'Fault diagnosis of ZDJ7 railway point machine based on improved DCNN and SVDD classification', 'subject': '', 'wps-articledoi': '10.1049/itr2.12357', 'author': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Fault_diagnosis_of_ZDJ7_railway_point_machine_base.pdf', 'total_pages': 26, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '1654'}, page_content='1654 SHI ET AL.\\nFIGURE 2 Structure of CNN.\\n3 IMPROVEMENT METHODS\\n3.1 Improved DCNN\\nThe traditional CNN is generally composed of the input layer,\\nconv layer, pooling layer, activation layer, density, and output\\nlayer. The essence of the CNN is to construct multiple ﬁlters\\nthat can extract features. Moreover, the input data are con-\\nvolved layer by layer to extract the topological structure features\\nhidden in the data. With the deepening of the network struc-\\nture, the feature representation of input data is ﬁnally obtained.\\nMeanwhile, sparse connections and parameter weight sharing\\nmechanisms can be combined to reduce dimension sampling in\\ntime and space. Thus, the data dimension is reduced. Also, the\\nnumber of training parameters are reduced. The algorithm over-\\nﬁtting is effectively avoided. It has invariance to scaling, tilting,\\ntranslation, and other forms of transformation. Therefore, it is\\nwidely used.\\nFigure 2 shows a typical CNN structure. The CNN can be\\nbuilt by stacking multiple convolutions, activation, and pool-\\ning combinations. However, complex industrial environment\\ndiagnosis may lead to errors in training sets and weak gen-\\neralization ability of new samples during the training process.\\nTherefore, CNN has a poor ability to extract features. The\\ntraining set deviation can be solved by expanding the training\\nsample and selecting the appropriate pretreatment feature. It\\ncan also be solved by adding a neural network to the CNN\\nto improve the training depth. However, the depth selection is\\nnot appropriate. And, the variance remains large. In addition,\\nthe structural design of the fully connected layer in CNN occu-\\npies too many computing resources. The test time of the CNN\\nmodel in the fully connected layer is too long because of the\\nexcessive number of parameters. In turn, it is not conducive to\\nrapid diagnosis.\\nTo further illustrate the fault features in the railway point\\nmachine, the modal component diagram and frequency diagram\\nof the sample during normal and fault are given in Figures3,\\n4. Figure 3a shows that the sample signal is a normal state.\\nThe decomposed mode is relatively clear. Although there is\\nnoise interference, the noise amplitude is small. When in the\\nfault state, the amplitude of signal noise interference is large\\n(Figure 3b).\\nIn turn, the obtained mode is basically submerged by high-\\nfrequency noise. The modes are prone to severe aliasing, and the\\nFIGURE 3 Comparison of sample modal components of the railway\\npoint machine.

Meanwhile, the GAP is used\\ninstead of the fully connected layer to improve the generaliza-\\ntion ability of the network. Step 4: After L2 regularization and\\nAdam optimization, the features are output. Further, we design\\nimproved DCNN and SVDD models for complete fault diag-\\nnosis of ZDJ7 railway point machine under unbalanced samples.\\nTherefore, we describe Xception structure optimization in\\nSection 3.1.1, AdaBN strategy optimization in Section 3.1.2,\\nGAP optimization in Section3.1.3, and Adam optimization in\\nSection 3.1.4.\\n3.1.1 Optimization of Xception structure\\nAfter Lenet-5 is proposed, almost all model generalization capa-\\nbilities of CNN is realized by deepening the depth of the\\nnetwork. Therefore, the possibility of overﬁtting and gradient\\ndisappearance will be greatly increased. The deeper the network\\nlayer is, the more difﬁcult the optimization will be. Therefore,\\nthe Inception structure is introduced in terms of the composi-\\ntion of the convolution kernel. The features of various levels of\\nthe network are extracted using the convolution kernel of mul-\\ntiple scales on the same layer. In addition, the features between\\ndifferent convolutions are not cross-computed. In turn, the\\nnetwork computation can be reduced to a certain extent. How-\\never, the original Inception module has the shortcoming that\\nthe 5*5 convolution kernel in the structure requires too much\\ncomputation.\\nHere, 1*1 convolution is used to reduce the dimension of the\\nfeature graph. In the end, the number of parameters decreases,\\nand the expression ability of the network becomes superior.\\nTo further improve the overﬁtting situation, the Inception-V3\\nmodule is continued to divide the two-dimensional convolu-\\ntional layer into two one-dimensional convolutional layers. After\\ncomprehensive analysis, the Inception-V3 model is set up as\\nshown in Figure 6. The GAP is inserted behind the Concat\\nlayer in the model to improve the accuracy of feature extraction.\\nGAP is used to reduce dimensionality by the pooling layer. The\\nspatial features and contextual semantic information extracted\\nfrom the previous convolutional and pooling layer are retained.\\nHowever, the general convolution computation in the model is\\ntoo large. In turn, it leads to a long training time.\\nTo further improve the accuracy of the sample training, the\\nXception module is continued for optimization. The depthwise\\nseparable convolution (DSConv) [51] is adopted by the model\\nto replace the original convolution operation in Inception-v3.\\nMeanwhile, traditional convolution is decomposed into layer-\\nby-layer and point-by-point convolution to reduce the amount\\nof computation. In the layer-by-layer convolution, the inputM\\nchannel feature maps are convolved withM ﬁlters. And,M fea-\\nture maps are output. In the layer-by-layer convolution, the main\\nfocus is the extraction of spatial plane features. The convolu-\\ntion computation is only limited to the interior of each channel.\\nTherefore, the information between channels is not fused. In\\npoint-by-point convolution, an eigen graph is output through\\nthe convolution layer by layer to output theM eigen graphs.\\nIn terms of computation amount, the amount of traditional\\nconvolution is as follows:\\nDk ×Dk ×M ×N ×DF ×DF (1)\\nDk is the convolution size, and theDF is the size of the input\\nfeature graph.M is the number of input feature graphs, andN\\nis the number of output feature graphs.

However, small changes accumulate con-\\ntinuously when passing through the multilayer network after\\nnormalization processing. Also, it leads to an excessive train-\\ning loss rate. Therefore, a batch normalization (BN) layer [52]\\nwill be added to the convolutional layer and the activation layer.\\nThe same operation will be performed between the fully con-\\nnected layer and the activation layer. Moreover, the main step\\nis to subtract the mean value of the minibatch from the convo-\\nlutional layer and the fully connected layer.

After the preliminary screening of samples,\\nthe redundant information in the remaining samples should be\\njudged. In SVDD model training, redundant information comes\\nfrom a certain amount of sample aggregation. Therefore, the\\ncluster non-boundary samples have no effect on the classiﬁ-\\ncation model training. The number of samples and the degree\\nof sample aggregation can be used as indicators to evaluate the\\nredundant information. Moreover, the degree of sample aggre-\\ngation is indicated by the Hopkins statistical scale. Speciﬁcally,\\nthe computation steps are as follows:\\n1.

In a similar way, n points (q1,q2,⋯ qn ) are uniformly\\nextracted from the sample set D. The nearest neighbour\\nof each pointqi in D −qi is found. Moreover, the nearest\\nneighbour distance betweenqi and D is yi . The computation\\ncan be expressed as follows.

Therefore, Hopkins statistics can\\nbe used to evaluate the clustering trend of samples in space.\\nMoreover, the classiﬁcation process based on the SVDD is\\nshown in Figure 9. A boundary extraction is used to solve\\nthe information loss lower boundary extraction from a single\\ncentre. The observation centre is set in the entire observation\\narea.

The G-mean and\\nMAUC indexes under different normal and fault samples are\\nprimarily compared. G-mean is an index to comprehensively\\ntest the accuracy of the two categories. Only when the accuracy\\nof both categories are high can a higher G-mean be obtained.\\nMAUC is the average AUC of classiﬁcation system. The larger\\ntwo values are, the better classiﬁcation will be. The algorithms\\ninclude the DBPN+SVDD, CNN3+SVDD, RNN3+SVDD,\\nDBN3+SVDD, One-classSVM, improved DCNN +SVDD\\n(proposed), and the speciﬁc results are shown in Table9.\\nThe conclusions obtained from Table9 are as follows: In\\nterms of the G-mean performance, the value obtained by the\\nproposed method is lower than that of the One-class SVM\\nmethod except in the normal (450)+fault (150) combination.\\nIn the other combinations, the proposed method is best. In\\nterms of MAUC performance, MAUC values are lower than\\nthose of the One-class SVM method except for normal (450)\\n+fault (200) and normal (500)+fault (150) combinations. In\\nthe other combinations, the proposed method is best. The two\\ndimensions of the sample and feature are analysed by One-Class\\nSVM by data distribution. The fault features are constructed\\nby improved SVDD into a single class of hyperspheres. The\\nclassiﬁcation of unbalanced sample is realized by the increment\\nof the hypersphere. Moreover, the information redundancy is\\nreduced by extracting boundary samples. Therefore, the classiﬁ-\\ncation effect is improved. In summary, the classiﬁcation validity\\nof the proposed method for unbalanced samples is veriﬁed by\\nthe G-mean and MAUC performance indexes. The improved\\nDCNN model in our method can fully capture the fault features\\ncompared to other diagnosis methods combining shallow net-\\nworks (CNN3, RNN3 and DBN3) with SVDD. Compared with\\nOne-class SVM, our designed SVDD model can achieve better\\nperformance in unbalanced sample fault diagnosis. When the\\nimproved DCNN and SVDD models are combined together,\\nthey can achieve excellent performance in fault diagnosis of\\nunbalanced samples.\\nTo compare the classiﬁcation effect more intuitively, we set\\nup a classiﬁcation visualization experiment in this section for\\nthe above method. The speciﬁc classiﬁcations are shown in\\nFigure 15a–f. The conclusions can be drawn from the ﬁgure:\\nWhen DPBN+SVDD is added (Figure15a), the normal and\\nfault sample are disordered and discrete. The samples cannot be\\neffectively classiﬁed.\\nWhen CNN3+SVDD (Figure15b) is used for classiﬁcation,\\nthe effect is improved to a certain extent compared with that\\nmentioned above. However, normal and fault samples still fail to\\nget effective separation. When the RNN3+SVDD (Figure15c)\\nis added, there is a certain degree of diffusion in the sample.\\nTherefore, the effect is still poor. When the DBN3+SVDD\\n(Figure 15d) is added, the effective classiﬁcations of normal and\\nattack are still not completed. After one-class SVM (Figure15e)\\nis added, normal and fault features are effectively classiﬁed.\\nHowever, the samples are mixed and the convergence effects of\\nthe sample are poor. When the proposed method (Figure15f)\\nis added, normal and fault sample have been fully classiﬁed.\\nAlso, the sample convergence effect is good. This again shows\\nthe validity of our improvements to the CNN.

Finally, an improved quan-\\ntity learning algorithm for hypersphere coordinate mapping\\nbased on SVDD is proposed. The classiﬁcation of unbalanced\\nsamples is realized.\\n4.5 Fault diagnosis results\\nThe diagnosis results of the different methods for normal and\\nfault samples under two settings are given in Table10.T h e\\nthree machine learning methods are divided into KNN (nearest\\nneighbour method), DT (decision tree) and SVM (support vec-\\ntor machine). There are 8 deep learning methods: DBPN (deep\\nartiﬁcial neural network), CNN3 (3-layer CNN), RNN3 (3-layer\\nrecurrent neural network), DBN3 (3-layer deep belief network).\\nMoreover, our method is built on the basis of CNN. The advan-\\ntages of our method can be demonstrated only by comparing\\nwith advanced CNN methods. Therefore, we choose the refs.\\n[10, 11] and Refs. [38, 40] for our experiments.\\nTable 10 shows that the highest accuracy of the proposed\\nmethod is 96.59%. However, the accuracy of the CNN3 net-\\nwork is only 80.40%. Also, it is lower than that of the SVM\\nmethod. Therefore, the diagnosis limitation of the CNN net-\\nwork itself is explained. This suggests that traditional machine\\nlearning methods are generally effective in extracting deeper\\nfault features. Thus leading to a lower ﬁnal accuracy rate.\\nAmong the deep learning based diagnosis methods, CNN, RNN\\nand DBN methods have average performance. The accuracy\\nrates are both lower than those in [10, 11]a n di n[38, 40]. This\\nis due to the large dataset and the overﬁtting problem of the\\nalgorithm itself. The proposed optimization strategy has the\\npotential to overcome the inherent limitations of CNN. Finally,\\na more accurate diagnosis is achieved. Our method also achieves\\ngood diagnosis performance when faced with unbalanced fault\\ndatasets. Therefore, we ﬁrst validate the diagnosis effectiveness\\nof the proposed method with the accuracy rates obtained from\\nthe unbalanced datasets.\\nTo further verify the diagnosis performance of the proposed\\nmethod, fault samples are recorded as fault, and normal samples\\nare recorded as normal. The ROC curve comparison experi-\\nment is conducted. The training and test ROC curves of the\\nrailway point machine dataset under the 6 methods is shown in\\nFIGURE 16 ROC curve comparison of training. (a) DBPN, (b) CNN3,\\n(c) RNN3, (d) ref.

[10], and the proposed method.\\nFigures 16 and 17 show that the AUC values obtained by\\nthe DBPN and CNN are relatively low in the ROC training\\nand test curves. Moreover, the BPNN with four hidden layers\\nhas a low accuracy of direct training of the original data. The\\ntraining accuracy of the BPNN with only one hidden layer is\\nvery low, and overﬁtting is severe. When the number of lay-\\ners exceeds 5, the accuracy of the DBPN is difﬁcult to improve\\nunder the inﬂuence of gradient disappearance. The overﬁtting is\\nprominent, which is consistent with the conclusions drawn from\\nTable 10. After the improvement of the CNN, the AUC value\\nobtained by the proposed method is relatively high in the train-\\ning and test ROC curves. After the improvement of the CNN,\\nthe AUC value is relatively high in the training and test ROC\\ncurves. Moreover, the AUC of the proposed method is supe-\\nrior to the normal and fault sample. In turn, it highlights the\\nnecessity of the optimization structure. However, this does not\\nfully explain the effective performance of our method.

Also, the problems such as gradient disappear-\\nance and overﬁtting inherent to these two networks affect the\\ntraining performance. In turn, this leads to poor ﬁnal diagno-\\nsis results. The training overﬁtting is caused by increasing the\\nnumber of layers of the CNN. It also more fully explains the\\nnecessity of the proposed method for improving the CNN. The\\nlargest average harmonic value of the F-score value is obtained\\nby the proposed method. In the comparison of AUC values,\\nall AUC values of the proposed method are better because the\\nappropriate number of training epoch is selected, and the loss\\nrate is low . This result is also consistent with the conclusion\\ndrawn from Figures 16 and 17. Similarly, the following con-\\nclusions can be drawn from Table12. First, in the diagnosis of\\nfault samples, the diagnosis performance is average regardless of\\nwhether three machine learning methods or nine deep learning\\nmethods are used. The average precision of the three machine\\nlearning methods is not more than 80%. Speciﬁcally, the aver-\\nage recall rate, average F-score value, and average AUC value are\\nfar lower than those of the proposed method. The accuracy rate\\nof the nine deep learning methods is lower than 92%. However,\\nthe performance of the proposed method remains the best. The\\nclassiﬁcation effect is relatively ideal compared with those of the\\nother methods.\\nIn summary, the effectiveness of the proposed method can\\nbe obtained by comparing several types of parameters under\\ndifferent methods. This also shows again that our proposed\\nimproved DCNN network is effective for CNNs. Our pro-\\nposed improvement strategy in the improved DCNN network\\nis able to address the inherent drawbacks of the CNN. Thereby,\\nit makes the model perform better in capturing the fault fea-\\ntures. Aiming at the unbalanced features of the railway point\\nmachine sample, an improved quantity learning algorithm for\\nhypersphere coordinate mapping based on SVDD is proposed.\\nIn turn, the classiﬁcation of unbalanced samples is realized.\\n4.6 Ablation experiments\\nIn the previous section, the diagnosis performance of the pro-\\nposed method and the current methods is mainly compared.\\nThe proposed method contains several improvement strategies.\\nTherefore, an ablation experiment is established to analyse the\\nrespective effects. In the experiment, the fault dataset of the rail-\\nway point machine is used as the baseline dataset. The baseline\\nnetwork is CNN network. When the improvement strategy is\\nsuccessively added, the accuracy of fault and normal sample is\\ng i v e ni nT a b l e13. The baseline experiment is carried out, and\\nthe speciﬁc idea is: Xception, AdaBN, GAP , L2 regularization,\\nAdam, and Dropout optimization methods are not added. In\\nthe fault and normal sample diagnosis tasks, the classiﬁcation\\naccuracy under this experiment is 65.96% and 70.35%, respec-\\ntively. Compared with the optimal result of the dataset, there is\\na big gap. This indicates that the network generalization ability\\nof pure CNN is poor. Therefore, the following contents verify\\nthe necessity of each step in the method in this paper, which are\\nmainly as follows:\\nFirst, the Xception optimization structure is added in the\\nexperiment. In the fault and normal sample diagnosis tasks,\\nthe classiﬁcation accuracy under this experiment is 69.12% and\\n72.63%, respectively. Compared with the baseline experiment,\\nthe improvement is 3.16% and 2.28%, respectively. Xception\\ncan solve the overﬁtting and gradient disappearance in the\\nnetwork proved by the result. Second, the AdaBN optimiza-\\ntion strategy is added in the experiment. Compared with the\\nbaseline experiment, the improvement is 4.12% and 3.66%,\\nrespectively. Third, the fully connected layer is replaced by GAP\\nlayer in the experiment. Compared with the baseline experi-\\nment, the improvement is 7.51% and 5.99%, respectively. When\\nthe original fully connected layer is replaced by GAP layer, the\\nresults show that the network complexity can be effectively\\nreduced. Fourth, the L2 regularization optimization strategy is\\nused in the experiment. As mentioned above, the classiﬁcation\\naccuracy under the experimental setting is improved by 5.44%\\nand 4.84%, respectively. This result indicates that unimpor-\\ntant feature variables are weakened by L2 regularization, while\\nimportant features are extracted from many feature variables.\\nFifth, the Adam optimization strategy is added in the experi-\\nment. The classiﬁcation accuracy under the experimental setting\\nincreases by 4.15% and 3.82%, respectively. When the varia-\\ntion Dropout optimization strategy is added, the classiﬁcation\\naccuracy under the experimental setting increased by 3.13% and\\n3.15%, respectively. The overﬁtting condition in the network\\ncan be well optimized by variation Dropout structure.\\nTo further verify the necessity of each step of the proposed\\nmethod, we remove each strategy and carry out the experiment.\\nThe speciﬁc results are shown in Table14. It can be observed\\nfrom Table14 that each strategy of the proposed method will\\naffect the accuracy of fault and normal sample diagnosis task.\\nTaking Xception as an example, the accuracy of the two sam-\\nples decrease by 2.21% and 1.41% when the Xception module is\\nremoved, respectively. There is also an impact on accuracy when\\nremoving other modules. This also means that none of our pro-\\nposed strategies can be removed. Each proposed strategy can\\naffect the diagnosis performance of our method. In turn, this\\nagain validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategies of\\nour model.\\n4.7 Robustness and model complexity\\nveriﬁcation\\nTo demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over\\nothers, the robustness and model complexity of these meth-\\nods are compared in terms of the average accuracy, standard\\ndeviation of accuracy, training time, and test time when dam-\\naged samples are found in the training samples.

When the damaged samples of other non-railway\\npoint machine samples are mixed, the performance of the\\nimproved DCNN is obviously better than those of the oth-\\ners. In terms of the comparison of average accuracy, the SVM\\nmethod has the highest accuracy (82.642%) among the three\\nmachine learning methods. However, the average accuracy of\\nthe BPNN with one hidden layer for direct training of origi-\\nnal data is only 80.371%. The training accuracy is very low, and\\noverﬁtting is severe. When the number of DBPN layers exceeds\\n5, it is difﬁcult to improve the accuracy under the inﬂuence of\\ngradient disappearance and overﬁtting. The average accuracy is\\nonly 1.268% higher than that of the BPNN, which is a small\\nincrease. Increasing the number of network layers of the CNN,\\nRNN, and DBN, it can improve the fault diagnosis accuracy.\\nHowever, the range is small. It is apparent by comparing the\\nCNN2 and CNN3 that simply increasing the number of net-\\nwork layers will also cause CNN overﬁtting. In turn, it leads\\nto low diagnosis accuracy. Although the training time of the\\nthree machine learning methods is much less than that of the\\nimproved DCNN, the improved DCNN has more advantages\\nfor real-time online monitoring and diagnosis in terms of test\\ntime. In conclusion, the proposed method is obviously superior\\nto other methods and has better stability. This also shows that\\nour method can be used for real-time fault diagnosis of ZDJ7\\nrailway point machine with better efﬁciency.\\nHowever, this does not fully validate the superiority of our\\nmethod in terms of computational complexity. Therefore, we\\nset up the following experiments: In addition to the training\\ntime and testing time given in Table15, we also use the number\\nof parameters, multiplication addition operations (FLOPs), and\\nPPL values as indexes [54]. These three indexes are used to test\\nthe computational power, and the smaller their values represent\\nthe greater computational power. To verify the efﬁciency of our\\nmodel in the presence of noise, we also give the indexes under\\ntwo settings (with and without noise), as shown in Table16.\\nFrom the results, our model obtain better indexes by virtue of'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 10.0.0 (Windows)', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2023-08-16T17:39:36+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-08-16T17:40:39+05:30', 'wps-journaldoi': '10.1049/(ISSN)1751-9578', 'wps-proclevel': '3', 'keywords': '', 'title': 'Fault diagnosis of ZDJ7 railway point machine based on improved DCNN and SVDD classification', 'subject': '', 'wps-articledoi': '10.1049/itr2.12357', 'author': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Fault_diagnosis_of_ZDJ7_railway_point_machine_base.pdf', 'total_pages': 26, 'page': 23, 'page_label': '1672'}, page_content='1672 SHI ET AL.\\nTABLE 16 Computational complexity comparison\\nWithout noise With noise\\nModel Parameters/M FLOPs/G PPL value Parameters/M FLOPS/G PPL value\\nKNN 69.341 68.630 62.412 72.847 71.352 63.557\\nDT 73.519 99.528 65.378 75.313 102.113 66.769\\nSVM 85.127 78.341 72.503 87.009 81.717 73.258\\nRef.

Also, better indexes\\nare obtained in the presence of noise. Although the number of\\nparameters and FLOPs have increased, the increase is not sig-\\nniﬁcant. Although the indexes obtained by our model are higher\\nthan those of the three models (CNN3, RNN3 and DBN3), the\\ndifference is not signiﬁcant. This difference is in an acceptable\\nrange for practical fault diagnosis. Therefore, this indicates that\\nour model is able to perform fault diagnosis of ZDJ7 railway\\npoint machine with strong noise background under unbalanced\\nsamples distributions.\\n5 CONCLUSIONS\\nAn intelligent fault diagnosis method for railway point machines\\nis proposed. The method is applied to the actual railway point\\nmachine fault dataset to verify the accuracy and superiority of\\nthe method, and the conclusions are as follows:\\n1. The proposed method has a higher fault diagnosis accuracy\\nand anti-noise ability. Moreover, it is applied to intelligent\\ndiagnosis of the fault experimental data. It has a higher\\naccuracy than methods based on manual feature extrac-\\ntion. Moreover, the proposed method has a shorter test\\ntime. Also, it is more conducive to the application of online\\nreal-time monitoring and rapid intelligent diagnosis.\\n2. The traditional CNN is improved by adopting the GAP ,\\nXception structure, and AdaBN. The number of train-\\ning parameters and computation time of the model are\\neffectively reduced. Also, the overﬁtting of the model is pre-\\nvented. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to\\nperform any manual feature extraction on the original fault\\ndata. In turn, the results show that the “end-to-end” model\\nstructure has better operability and generality.\\n3. The designed optimized boundary extraction algorithm\\nbased on SVDD can classify unbalanced fault samples with\\nhigh accuracy. The accuracy rate, recall rate, FPR, F-score\\nand AUC value are better than other methods. Moreover, it\\nhas a strong robustness and superior diagnosis performance\\nwhen samples are destroyed.\\n4. Although our model is able to achieve some performance\\nin fault diagnosis with unbalanced samples, it is no longer\\napplicable in the face of sample sparsity and few-shot sam-\\nple distribution. Considering that domain adaption can solve\\nthe fault diagnosis problem with sparse samples, we will use\\ndomain adaption theory to solve the few-shot sample fault\\ndiagnosis problem in the next phase of our work.\\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\\nZengshu Shi: Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology,\\nResources, Software, Validation, Writing – original draft; Yiman\\nDu: Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Super-\\nvision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing;\\nXinwen Yao: Investigation, Software, Visualization.\\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\\nThe authors declare no conﬂicts of interest.\\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\\nThe data that support the ﬁndings of this study are available\\nfrom the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\\nREFERENCES\\n1.

INTRODUCTION \\n \\nIndian   Railways (IR)   is   a governmental body   under \\nthe Ministry of Railways which manages India's national \\nrailway system. It is run by the government as a public benefit \\nand manages the third -largest railway  network  in  the \\nworld by size, with a route length of 68,155 km (42,350 mi) \\nas of March 2019.[3] Railway signaling is a system used to \\ndirect railway traffic and keep trains always clear of each \\nother. The heart of Railway signaling systems are Point \\nMachine, Track Circuits and Signals. To keep the whole \\nsystem up it is particularly important to maintain these gears \\nand prevent from failures or accidents. Condition Monitoring \\nand Predictive analysis can be helpful to prevent from failures \\nbefore they happen. \\n \\nPredictive analysis and condition monitoring can be \\nachieved using cutting -edge technology like Machine \\nLearning, Artificial Intelligence, IoT, etc. But in this all \\ntechnology requires a data as primary requirement. By \\nMeasuring the voltage and current parameters continuously \\nwith the help of data acquisiti on unit called Event Logger. \\nAlso, it is important to measure the data non intrusively to \\nensure the safety of existing railway circuits. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPoint Machine \\nPoint Machine is a device which is used for the \\noperating railway turnout especially at a distance.

[3] \\nThe driver interprets the signal's indication and acts \\naccordingly. Typically, a signal might inform the driver of \\nthe speed at which the train may safely proceed, or it may  \\ninstruct the driver to stop. \\n \\n \\nFig.3 \\n \\nIn Signal, following are the important parameters to be \\nmonitored: \\n\\uf0b7 Each aspect Voltage and Current \\n\\uf0b7 TPR Relay Voltage \\n \\n \\nII. PROBLEM STATEMENT \\n \\nA. Point Machine \\nThe Point Machine operates when there is any \\ndiversion of train from one track to another track. Usually \\npoint machines are far away from the station and when point \\nis operated  there can be obstruction in between stock and \\ntongue rail results train delay. Sometimes obstruction in \\nbetween the rails but the point is set and lock that can affect \\nnext operation of Point Machine. \\n \\nDue to many numbers of active components in point \\nmotor the chances of failures increase. Due to poor \\nlubrication the point machine can draw more current than its \\nnormal operating current. Due to improper high or low \\npressure on lock nut rods can create unsafe condition to the \\npoint. \\n \\nB. DC Track Circuit \\nThe DC Track circuits operates with the help of Feed \\nvoltage from Battery and the battery  needs to charge \\ncontinuously with the track feed battery charger then receives \\nat the relay end away from feed end this leads generation of \\nleakages, ballast resistance and track resistance. So, it is \\nrequired to maintain these parameters not exceeding to  its \\npermissible range. \\n  \\nMost of the time Charger gets fails or turned off and \\nbattery does not charge properly cause failure of sufficient \\ndelivery of feed voltage. Choke filters the noises in the \\nvoltages sometimes coil failure of choke can leads to generate \\nspikes in the voltage. \\n \\nWhen Train Enters into the section and exits from the \\nsection, Track circuit should clear, and unoccupied but \\nsometimes specific Track Circuit gets not clear and shows \\noccupied. \\n \\nTrack circuits gets fails due to 24 V External DC \\nSupply or relay fails, sudden break of jumper cable or fuse \\nblown off. \\n \\nC. Signals \\nIn Signals most of the failures happens because of fuse \\nblown off, quad cable leakage, load current on aspects \\ndecreases gradually and reach to its permissible range. Wrong \\noperation of signals. Signal bobbing. \\n \\nIII. PROPOSED SOLUTION \\n \\nThe Event Logger RTU which is a microprocessor \\nbased data acquisition unit continuously monitors the \\nvoltages and current at the outdoor cable termination point \\nand sends the data  to cloud/server with the help of available \\ncommunication media like Zigbee/LoRA/LTE/Ethernet. \\n \\nOn the server/cloud with the help of IoT and AI -ML \\nPlatform we can get the real time analytics on the data. With \\nthe help of timeseries data & various machine learning \\nalgorithm l ike linear regression, ARIMA models can be \\nhelpful to predict the future failures of the gears.\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'www.ilovepdf.com', 'creator': 'Microsoft® Word 2016', 'creationdate': '2021-01-16T15:31:28+00:00', 'title': 'Remote Diagnostic and Predictive Maintenace of Signalling Gears', 'author': 'tapashp@hotmail.com', 'keywords': 'Remote Diagnostic and Predictive Maintenace of Signalling Gears', 'moddate': '2021-01-16T15:31:29+00:00', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\IJISRT21JAN148.pdf', 'total_pages': 5, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Volume 6, Issue 1, January – 2021                                         International Journal of  Innovative Science and Research Technology                                                 \\n                                         ISSN No:-2456-2165 \\n \\nIJISRT21JAN148                                                                 www.ijisrt.com                     225 \\nA.

      "\n",
      "**Fault Detection in Point Machines**\n",
      "\n",
      "Point machines, also known as turnout machines or switch machines, play a crucial role in railway operations. They control the movement of trains by switching tracks, allowing them to change direction or access different routes. However, point machines are prone to faults, which can cause disruptions to train services and compromise safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fault Detection Methods**\n",
      "\n",
      "Several methods can be employed for fault detection in point machines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Current-based Fault Diagnosis Method**: This method involves monitoring the current drawn by the point machine's motors and electrical components. By analyzing the current patterns, technicians can identify potential faults or anomalies that may indicate a problem.\n",
      "2. **Vibration Analysis**: Point machines generate vibrations during operation, which can be measured using sensors. Changes in vibration patterns or levels can indicate wear and tear or impending failure of mechanical components.\n",
      "3. **Temperature Monitoring**: Electrical and mechanical components within the point machine can overheat due to excessive usage or worn bearings. Temperature monitoring can help identify potential faults before they cause a breakdown.\n",
      "4. **Pressure Sensors**: Point machines have pressure sensors that monitor the operation of switches, signals, and other mechanisms. Faults in these systems can be detected by analyzing pressure sensor readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Common Faults in Point Machines**\n",
      "\n",
      "Some common faults encountered in point machines include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Switch failure**: Failure to operate or misaligned switches can cause trains to become stuck or derail.\n",
      "2. **Motor overheating**: Overheating of motors can lead to reduced performance, premature wear, and eventual breakdown.\n",
      "3. **Bearings failure**: Worn-out bearings can cause excessive vibration, noise, and reduced lifespan of the point machine.\n",
      "4. **Electrical faults**: Short circuits, blown fuses, or faulty wiring can disrupt power supply and cause system failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges in Fault Detection**\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementing fault detection methods for point machines poses several challenges:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sensor Reliability**: Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of sensors used to monitor point machine performance is crucial.\n",
      "2. **Cost Implications**: Installing and maintaining advanced monitoring systems can be expensive, which may hinder adoption by maintenance teams.\n",
      "3. **Complexity of Integration**: Integrating fault detection methods with existing monitoring systems and alert mechanisms requires technical expertise and planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Implementation Steps**\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement a current-based fault diagnosis method for point machines in real-world railway operations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sensor Installation**: Install sensors to monitor the current drawn by motors, electrical components, and other critical areas.\n",
      "2. **Data Collection**: Collect data from sensors using specialized software or hardware.\n",
      "3. **Data Transmission**: Send collected data to a central server for processing.\n",
      "4. **Data Processing**: Analyze data to identify potential faults or anomalies.\n",
      "5. **Integration with Monitoring System**: Integrate fault detection methods with existing monitoring systems and alert mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Fault detection in point machines is essential for maintaining railway safety and efficiency. Implementing advanced monitoring systems, such as current-based fault diagnosis, requires careful consideration of sensor reliability, cost implications, and complexity of integration.\n"
